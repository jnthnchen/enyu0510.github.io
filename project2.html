        <h1>Home-Delivered Meals Prioritization Tool</h1>
        <p>
          When I was studying dietetics before my transition into information
          science, I was given the wonderful opportunity to help develop a
          mobile application that would facilitate the process of screening
          older adults for food security. Through the use of this tool, older
          adults are prioritized into different food security levels and the
          data are imported into a spreadsheet to make it easier for health
          professionals to determine their food security needs. This app
          essentially asked the user a series of questions developed by the
          University of Maryland's College of Agriculture and Natural Resources
          Department of Nutrition and Food Science. Different answers led to
          different questions and points in order to ultimately determine the
          individual's priority level.

        <p>
          This app was developed through Thunkable X, a platform for creating
          mobile applications that are compatible with both iOS and Android. To
          store the data collected via the app, I used Airtable, which is a
          cloud collaboration service that provides spreadsheet-database hybrid
          products. The information collected from the app is sent to an
          Airtable in which health professionals get access to the data and
          results collected by the app.
