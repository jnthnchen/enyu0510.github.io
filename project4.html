        <h1>Life Expectancy Data Analysis</h1>
        <p>
          This project was developed in R, and it seeks to answer the question
          of how alcohol consumption, BMI, schooling, and status affect life
          expectancy. The dataset used was from the Global Health Observatory
          data repository under the World Health Organization. I built several
          multiple regression models to determine the best model. The null
          hypothesis was: Model with no independent variables fits life
          expectancy well enough, H0: R2=0. The alternative hypothesis was:
          Model with at least one independent variable better fits life
          expectancy than the intercept only model, Ha: R2 ≠0.
        </p>
        <p>
          Model 1 used numerical independent variables (alcohol, BMI, schooling)
          and life expectancy as the dependent variable.The result was
          F(3,2565), p<0.05, R^2=0.590. Model 2 used categorical independent
          variable (status) and life expectancy as the dependent variable. The
          result was F(1,2567)=748.8, p<0.05, R2=0.226. Model 3 used all the
          significant independent variables from our previous two models based
          on p-value (alcohol, BMI, schooling, status) and life expectancy as
          the dependent variable. The result was F(4,2564)=987.7, p<0.05,
          R2=0.606. The best model was Model 3, and its regression assumption
          diagnostic plots are below.

        <p>
          The equation for Model 3 was Y=45.000 – (0.269*Alcohol) + (0.105*BMI)
          + (1.732*Schooling) + (4.034*Status). My findings were statistically
          significant at the selected alpha level of 0.05 since p<0.05. As a
          result, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the model with
          at least one independent variable better fits life expectancy than the
          intercept only model. Our findings can be generalized to the
          population since our samples passed all of the regression assumptions.
          The implication from my study is that alcohol consumption, BMI,
          education, and status of a country do affect life expectancy. As a
          result, countries can work on improving their population’s health by
          slightly decreasing alcohol consumption, increasing BMIs to a healthy
          level, and increase schooling. Developed countries also tend to have
          longer life expectancies than developing countries as expected.
