        <h1>Heart Attack Data Analysis</h1>
        <p>
          This project, developed in Python, analyzed heart attack data which
          have been organized into 14 variables used by all published
          experiments: age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum
          cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic
          results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, ST
          depression induced by exercise relative to rest, slope of the ST
          segment, number of major vessels colored by flourosopy, thal, and the
          target value, which can be 0 (less chance of heart attack) or 1 (more
          change of heart attack). This program created a heatmap for
          correlation visualization, created swarmplot(s) of 2 variables of
          interest + target combinations, executed statistical analysis, and
          then fed relevant data into an SVM model tested by 10-fold cross
          validation to better understand which of these variables significantly
          affect(s) the probability of heart attack.

        <p>
          After visualization and statistical analysis, some of the variables
          that affect probablity of heart attack were determined to be mean
          maximum heart rate, exercise induced angina, and number of major
          vessels colored by flourosopy. The SVM model trained using these data
          was able to predict target values at around 70% accuracy.
