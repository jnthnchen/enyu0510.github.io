        <h1>Weather Database</h1>
        <p>
          This group project was to design and create a database using MySQL.
          The dataset we chose was from Kaggle and consisted of weather data
          from major cities in the world. As weather is a globally relevant
          phenomenon and climate change being a hot topic, we thought that a
          weather database would be useful to both scientists and the general
          public. This weather data included humidity, pressure, temperature,
          weather description, wind direction, and wind speed. In addition, we
          created some of our own data such as altitude, precipitation, air
          quality, and cloudiness. Due to the enormous amount of data within the
          Kaggle dataset, we reduced the number of cities to just 10 for
          manageability. Furthermore, we decided to limit our date/time records
          to 500 hours worth of data. The whole project took careful planning,
          drafting, normalizing, and importing. The final entity relationship
          diagram is below.
