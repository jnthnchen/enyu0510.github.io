        <h1>Packaged Meals Data Analysis</h1>
        <p>
          For the 2021 UMD data challenge, my team chose to analyze a dataset
          provided by the USDA. The data consisted of over 4400 rows of food and
          ingredient information. We first did some surface-level cleaning using
          OpenRefine. Then we used Python to further clean the data by removing
          parentheses and brackets. Finally, we used the Python Matplotlib
          library to create bar charts for data visualization. What we
          discovered was that a lot of the top ingredients in these packaged
          foods are preservatives, additives, or stabilizers. In addition, we
          determined that dairy/egg-based products seem to be the healthiest
          meal category due to the high amount of vitamins/minerals and low
          amount of preservatives. Salt, water, and sugar were found in the
          highest number of ingredient combinations. Soy and its derivatives
          were found to be very popular ingredients. As a result, we suggested a
          focus on the soy industry supply chain as soy is critical not only as
          a food ingredient but also as a feed ingredient in the meat industry.
